## Project Brief

It's your first day at your new programming job at the infamous CIA bothering shop WikiLeaks.  While Julian Assange has been busy [eating Ferrero Rocher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P-nZZkQqTc), it seems that coding standards have slipped.  Your new boss calls you over, and explains that he's been implementing a bidirectional map(*) for hashing and the vital secrecy at WikiLeaks. Before running off for a long, boozy lunch he asks you to take a look over the code because it keeps running out of memory.

You open the project to find [this monstrosity](https://gist.github.com/oampo/da35215db9cd794c7aff).  All you have to do to keep your boss happy is to track down and fix every memory leak.


## Resources

* For a high-level recap of references in JavaScript take a look at [this chapter of JavaScript Allong√©](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/js-allonge-book/blob/master/content/3_References%20and%20Rebinding/content.md)
* [This article](http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/self-detect-memory-leak-node/) introduces two Node.js modules which can be used to detect memory leaks in a Node application.  Note that the version of Memwatch linked by the article is outdated.  You should use [this fork](https://github.com/marcominetti/node-memwatch) instead.
* The Chrome memory profiler can help you visualize how memory is being used in your application.  There is information about how to use the profiles, plus some useful information about how memory is stored and free in [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling)
* [This article from Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/nodejs-in-flames.html) has a great account of finding an fixing a memory leak in a Node.js app.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Test-Driving the Map

Download and test out [the code](https://gist.github.com/oampo/da35215db9cd794c7aff).  Try out the examples in the comments to make sure they work.  Try adding, removing, and filtering large groups of items whilst watching the memory usage.  Can you detect any leaks?  Does anything not work how you expected it to?  If you need some help understanding when memory might leak, have a read of the [MDN documentation on memory management](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management).

### Milestone 2: Understanding the Code

Take a read through the code, paying particular attention to any parts which seems unusual, or where you discovered leaky behavior in milestone 1.  Are there any obvious errors which would cause memory leaks?

### Milestone 3: Plug the Leaks

Update the code to remove all memory leaks.  Although you might feel that a complete rewrite is in order (it definitely is!), think of your bosses feelings and try to keep the feel of the original code.

## Footnotes

(*) Programmer Joke Alert: This one relies on you knowing that a [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) is almost definitely a bad choice for implementing a Bidirectional Hashmap, a data-structure which has very little to do with secrecy and security.
